# Calculator
An [assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/calculator) from The Odin Project.

## Description

A simple calculator app. It takes input via button click or keypress and performs basic mathematical operations.

## Learning outcomes
In the course of this project I improved my abiilty to write Javascript handling DOM manipulation, including receiving user input via button click and keypress, manipulating the input, and outputting the result to DOM elements. I practiced handling edge cases (eg. overly large numbers, numbers too long to fit on screen, division by 0, and invalid inputs). I also learned basics of visual design (including choosing a suitable colour scheme) and practiced using CSS to deliver a clean and intuitive user interface. 

## Room for improvement

- Error arising from floating point imprecision is not currently addressed.
- Currently, numbers larger than Javascript's max int size are not allowed. This could potentially be overcome, eg. with BigInt.
- More complex mathematical operations could be implemented.
